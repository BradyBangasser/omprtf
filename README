This is a program that uses a profiler to optimize programs that use OpenMP GPU Offloading. 

With the exception of the profiler, which has been heavily modified, and the hash function used by the profile,
which I did not modify, all software has been written by Brady Bangasser

To build and run, simply run build.sh,
then run the program

./build/omprtf <yourfile>.ll
